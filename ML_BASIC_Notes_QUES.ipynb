        "Hi,  my name is Akashpati Mishra. I had done B.tech in Mechanical engineering. After graduating I joined my family business. We have a building material and sanitaryware wholesell shops. There i got a chance to learn about inventory management, customer handling. As I saw that growth in our business is saturate after a few time and I can utilise me to other field. from childhood I was intrested in stats and graph and I also want work in field which is growing with time and where i can involve in direct business decisions and I also want to be a part of new AI tools generation either then only seeting and using AI tools. so I was searching for field where i can utilize my intrest so came to know about data science. first I started learning by myself learnt python then after 2 moths learning by my own I soon realized that to grasp fast a proper guidance is required so I joined Almabetter as a trainee and from past 1 year I had learnt a lot of skills and also i had done few real time projects to get practical experience. Firstly I learnt Python and its few libraries then I learnt SQl then I had done a small project on Python. After that I learnt some of visualisation tools like Seaborn, Tableau, PowerBi, after I learnt Machine learning and also I had done 3 projects on Machine Learning"

Hybrid recommender systems that combine multiple approaches can also help mitigate these problems by incorporating additional sources of information."
